# About *Is There a Game Today?*

This web app is for commuters and residents of the city of Seattle who want to know whether there is a professional sports event happening in the SODO district on a given day. Gameday information is useful whether you are going to the game or want to avoid traffic. Currently home game schedules are only provided for MLB, MLS, and NFL games (no preseason/friendly games).
